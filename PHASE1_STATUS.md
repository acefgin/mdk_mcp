- ⚠️ AWS Athena support is placeholder

### Week 5: Unified Tools & Advanced Features ✅
- ✅ Unified `get_sequences` tool with source routing
- ✅ Format standardization across all sources
- ✅ Comprehensive input validation
- ✅ Implemented `get_neighbors` tool (taxonomic traversal)
- ✅ Implemented `get_taxonomy` tool (multi-source resolution)
- ✅ **BONUS**: Implemented `extract_sequence_columns` tool
  - Parses FASTA headers and GenBank records
  - Extracts 20+ metadata fields
  - Supports JSON/CSV/TSV/Table output formats

### Week 6: Testing & Quality Assurance ⚠️ (In Progress)
- ✅ Created unit test structure
- ✅ Basic test scripts (test_basic.py, test_mcp_client.py)
- ❌ Comprehensive unit tests for all tools not written
- ❌ Mock external API calls not implemented
- ❌ Integration tests incomplete
- ❌ Performance testing not done
- ❌ Container testing incomplete

### Week 7: Documentation & Deployment ⚠️ (Partial)
- ✅ Basic API documentation in README.md
- ✅ Docker container builds successfully
- ✅ Docker-compose configuration complete
- ✅ Environment variables configured
- ✅ MCP server manifest (mcp-server.json) created
- ❌ Comprehensive usage examples incomplete
- ❌ Error codes not documented
- ❌ Kubernetes deployment manifests not created
- ❌ Monitoring and alerting not set up
- ❌ Production optimization not done

## 🚧 Remaining Tasks for Phase 1

### High Priority (Week 6)
1. **Complete Unit Testing**
   - Write unit tests for all 12+ MCP tools
   - Mock external API calls (NCBI, BOLD, SRA)
   - Test error conditions and edge cases
   - Create test data fixtures

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test real API calls with rate limiting
   - Validate output formats across all tools
   - Test large-scale data retrieval
   - Performance testing with concurrent requests

3. **Container Testing**
   - Test container startup and health checks
   - Memory and CPU usage profiling
   - Test all dependencies properly installed

### Medium Priority (Week 7)
4. **Documentation**
   - Complete API documentation with examples for each tool
   - Document error codes and troubleshooting
   - Create developer setup guide
   - Add usage examples for common workflows

5. **Production Readiness**
   - Optimize Docker image size
   - Configure production logging
   - Create Kubernetes deployment manifests
   - Set up basic monitoring

### Low Priority (Future)
6. **Database Enhancements**
   - Complete SILVA integration (currently placeholder)
   - Complete UNITE integration (currently placeholder)
   - Implement distributed caching
   - Add BigQuery credentials management
