- ✅ **Integration tests complete**
  - Multi-step workflows
  - Error propagation testing
  - MCP tool call integration
- ✅ **Test documentation** (tests/README.md)
- ⚠️ Performance testing not done (requires real API calls)
- ⚠️ Container testing incomplete (requires Docker environment)

### Week 7: Documentation & Deployment ⚠️ (Partial)
- ✅ Basic API documentation in README.md
- ✅ Docker container builds successfully
- ✅ Docker-compose configuration complete
- ✅ Environment variables configured
- ✅ MCP server manifest (mcp-server.json) created
- ❌ Comprehensive usage examples incomplete
- ❌ Error codes not documented
- ❌ Kubernetes deployment manifests not created
- ❌ Monitoring and alerting not set up
- ❌ Production optimization not done

## 🚧 Remaining Tasks for Phase 1

### High Priority (Week 6) - ✅ COMPLETED

   - ✅ Test error conditions and edge cases
   - ✅ Created test data fixtures

2. **~~Integration Testing~~** ✅
   - ✅ Complete MCP workflow tests
   - ✅ Validate output formats across all tools
   - ⚠️ Large-scale data retrieval (requires real APIs)
