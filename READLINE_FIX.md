# Readline Fix - Complete Backspace Solution

## 🐛 Problem (Persistent Issue)

Even after switching from `docker attach` to `docker exec`, backspace still wasn't working. Users saw `^H` characters instead of proper deletion:

```
└─> Not u^Hsu^H^H^H
```

Then after adding readline, backspace worked but **deleted the prompt arrow** `└─>` when pressed at the beginning of input.

## 🔍 Root Cause

The issue had **three layers** that needed to be fixed:

**Layer 1: TTY Problem**
- Using `docker attach` didn't provide proper TTY allocation
- Fixed by switching to `docker exec -it`

**Layer 2: Readline Not Enabled**
- Python's `input()` doesn't use readline by default
- Fixed by importing readline module and calling `setup_readline()`

**Layer 3: Prompt Deletion Issue** (Final fix)
- When using `print()` then `input()` separately, readline doesn't know where prompt ends
- Color codes were being treated as printable characters
- Pressing backspace at beginning would delete the prompt arrow
- **Fixed by using `colored_input()` with readline escape sequences**

**Complete requirements for working line editing:**
1. ✅ TTY allocated properly (`-it` flag)
2. ✅ Terminal in correct mode (`stty sane`)
3. ✅ **Readline module imported and configured**
4. ✅ **Color codes wrapped in `\001` and `\002` escape sequences**
5. ✅ **Prompt passed directly to `input()` function**

## ✅ Complete Solution

### 1. Import readline Module

**File:** `autogen_app/qpcr_assistant.py`

```python
import readline  # Import readline for proper line editing support
```

**Why:** The `readline` module provides line editing and history features to Python's `input()` function.

### 2. Setup readline Configuration

Added `setup_readline()` function:

```python
def setup_readline():
    """Configure readline for proper line editing (backspace, arrow keys, etc.)"""
    try:
        # Enable readline features
        readline.parse_and_bind('tab: complete')  # Tab completion
        readline.parse_and_bind('set editing-mode emacs')  # Emacs-style editing

        # Set up history
        histfile = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser("~"), ".qpcr_assistant_history")
        try:
            readline.read_history_file(histfile)
            readline.set_history_length(1000)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            pass

        # Save history on exit
        import atexit
        atexit.register(readline.write_history_file, histfile)

    except Exception as e:
        # Readline might not be available on all systems
        pass
```

**Features enabled:**
- ✅ Backspace / Delete
- ✅ Arrow keys (left/right for navigation, up/down for history)
- ✅ Home / End keys
- ✅ Ctrl+A / Ctrl+E (beginning/end of line)
- ✅ Ctrl+K / Ctrl+U (kill line)
- ✅ Tab completion
- ✅ Command history (saved between sessions)

### 3. Create colored_input() Helper Function

**File:** `autogen_app/qpcr_assistant.py` (lines 821-835)

```python
def colored_input(prompt_text: str, prompt_color: str = Colors.BRIGHT_CYAN) -> str:
    """
    Get input with a colored prompt that readline understands.
    Uses readline-compatible escape sequences to prevent prompt deletion.
    """
    # Readline escape sequences to mark non-printing characters
    # \001 = RL_PROMPT_START_IGNORE
    # \002 = RL_PROMPT_END_IGNORE
    rl_start = '\001'
    rl_end = '\002'

    # Wrap color codes in readline ignore markers
    colored_prompt = f"{rl_start}{prompt_color}{rl_end}{prompt_text}{rl_start}{Colors.RESET}{rl_end}"

    return input(colored_prompt)
```

**Why this is critical:**
- Readline needs to know which characters are printable (for cursor positioning)
- ANSI color codes are non-printable but take up space in the string
- Without `\001`/`\002` markers, readline counts color codes as printable characters
- This causes cursor position calculation errors, leading to prompt deletion

**Before (problematic):**
```python
print(f"└─> ", end="", flush=True)  # Readline doesn't know this is the prompt
user_input = input().strip()         # Backspace can delete the prompt
```

**After (fixed):**
```python
user_input = colored_input("└─> ").strip()  # Readline knows prompt boundaries
```

### 4. Call setup_readline() at Startup

```python
async def interactive_mode():
    """Run interactive chat interface."""
    # Setup readline for proper terminal input handling
    setup_readline()

    # Ensure terminal is in proper state
    try:
        os.system('stty sane 2>/dev/null')
    except:
        pass

    # ... rest of code
```

### 5. Update All Input Prompts

**All input prompts updated to use `colored_input()`:**

**Clarification workflow (5 questions):**
```python
# Question 1: Target species
plan["target_species"] = colored_input("└─> ").strip()

# Question 2: Off-target species
off_targets = colored_input("└─> ").strip()

# Question 3: Genomic region
region = colored_input("└─> ").strip()

# Question 4: Application context
plan["application"] = colored_input("└─> ").strip()

# Question 5: Additional requirements
requirements = colored_input("└─> ").strip()
```

**Confirmation prompt:**
```python
confirmation = colored_input("└─> ").strip().lower()
```

**Main interactive loop:**
```python
user_input = colored_input("└─> ").strip()
```

### 6. Enhanced Shell Script

Updated `start_interactive.sh` to set proper environment:

```bash
docker exec -it qpcr-assistant bash -c "
# Set terminal to proper state
stty sane 2>/dev/null || true
export TERM=xterm-256color

# Start interactive mode with Python
cd /app && python3 -c 'import asyncio; from qpcr_assistant import interactive_mode; asyncio.run(interactive_mode())'
"
```

**Why:**
- `TERM=xterm-256color` - Tells programs terminal capabilities
- `stty sane` - Resets terminal to normal state
- `bash -c` - Runs in bash shell with proper environment

## 🎯 Now Working

## 📊 Technical Details

### How readline Works

```
User presses key
      ↓
Terminal sends to Python
      ↓
readline intercepts (if imported)
      ↓
readline processes:
  - Backspace → delete char
  - Arrow → move cursor
  - Enter → return line
      ↓
input() returns complete line
```

### Without readline:
```
User presses backspace
      ↓
Terminal sends ^H (ASCII 8)
      ↓
input() sees literal ^H
      ↓
Displays "^H" as text ❌
```

### With readline:
```
User presses backspace
      ↓
Terminal sends ^H
      ↓
readline intercepts ^H
      ↓
readline deletes character ✅
      ↓
input() returns edited line
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: Backspace
```
└─> Hello World
[Press backspace 5 times]
└─> Hello
✅ Deleted "World"
```

### Test 2: Arrow Keys
```
└─> test123
[Press left arrow 3 times]
└─> test|123  (cursor at |)
[Type "ABC"]
└─> testABC123
✅ Inserted at cursor
```

### Test 3: Ctrl+A / Ctrl+E
```
└─> middle text here
[Press Ctrl+A]
└─> |middle text here  (cursor at start)
[Type "start "]
└─> start middle text here
✅ Moved to beginning
```

### Test 4: History
```
└─> First command
[Enter]
└─> Second command
[Enter]
└─> [Press up arrow]
└─> Second command  (recalled)
[Press up arrow]
└─> First command  (recalled)
✅ History works
```

### Test 5: Command History Persistence
```
Session 1:
└─> Design qPCR for salmon
[Exit]

Session 2:
└─> [Press up arrow]
└─> Design qPCR for salmon  (from previous session!)
✅ History persisted
```

## 🎓 Why Readline Escape Sequences Matter

### The Problem: Colored Prompts in Readline

When you use ANSI color codes in a prompt, readline sees them as regular characters:

```
Prompt string: "\033[96m└─> \033[0m"
           Color start ^^^^ Text ^^^^ Color reset ^^^^
```

**Without escape sequences:**
- Readline counts: 14 characters (including color codes)
- Actually visible: 4 characters (`└─> `)
- Cursor position calculation: WRONG!
- Result: Backspace deletes prompt because readline thinks cursor is at position 14

**With escape sequences:**
```python
prompt = f"\001\033[96m\002└─> \001\033[0m\002"
#        ^^^^ mark start    ^^^^ mark end
```
- Readline knows `\001...\002` sections are non-printable
- Counts only: 4 visible characters
- Cursor position calculation: CORRECT!
- Result: Prompt is protected, backspace stops at position 0

### The Solution: colored_input()

```python
def colored_input(prompt_text: str, prompt_color: str = Colors.BRIGHT_CYAN) -> str:
    rl_start = '\001'  # Tell readline: ignore following chars
    rl_end = '\002'    # Tell readline: stop ignoring

    # Wrap color codes properly
    colored_prompt = f"{rl_start}{prompt_color}{rl_end}{prompt_text}{rl_start}{Colors.RESET}{rl_end}"
    return input(colored_prompt)
```

This ensures:
1. Readline knows which characters are actually visible
2. Cursor position is calculated correctly
3. Prompt boundaries are respected
4. Colors work perfectly without breaking line editing

## 🎓 Why readline is Important

### Without readline:
```python
# Plain input() - no line editing
name = input("Name: ")
# User types: "Joh"
# Wants to fix typo but backspace shows ^H
# Result: "Joh^H^H" → Wrong!
```

### With readline:
```python
# After import readline
import readline
name = input("Name: ")
# User types: "Joh"
# Presses backspace → deletes "h"
# Types "hn" → "John"
# Result: "John" → Correct!
```

## 🔍 Verification

To verify readline is working:

```bash
# Start the assistant
./start_interactive.sh

# Test backspace
└─> test123[backspace][backspace][backspace]
# Should show: test

# Test arrow keys
└─> test[left][left]XX
# Should show: teXXst

# Test history
└─> command 1
# Press enter
└─> command 2
# Press enter
└─> [up arrow]
# Should recall: command 2

# Test Ctrl+A
└─> end of line[Ctrl+A]START
# Should show: STARTend of line
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### For Users
1. **Natural typing experience** - Like any modern terminal
2. **Fix mistakes easily** - Backspace works!
3. **Navigate efficiently** - Arrow keys, Home/End
4. **Recall commands** - History with up/down arrows
5. **Power user features** - Ctrl shortcuts

### For System
1. **Better UX** - Professional terminal interface
2. **Reduced frustration** - No more ^H characters
3. **Increased productivity** - Fast editing and history
4. **Standard behavior** - Matches user expectations

## 🚨 Known Limitations

### 1. History is per-user, not global
- Each user's history saved in their home directory
- Docker container uses `/root/.qpcr_assistant_history`
- History preserved between sessions

### 2. Tab completion is basic
- Implemented for readline compatibility
- Not context-aware (yet)
- Could be enhanced with custom completer

### 3. Readline not available on all systems
- Mainly an issue on Windows (without WSL)
- Gracefully falls back if not available
- Linux/Mac always have readline

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Smart Tab Completion**
   ```python
   def complete_species(text, state):
       species = ['Salmo salar', 'Oncorhynchus mykiss', ...]
       matches = [s for s in species if s.startswith(text)]
       return matches[state] if state < len(matches) else None

   readline.set_completer(complete_species)
   ```

2. **Syntax Highlighting**
   - Could use `prompt_toolkit` for rich input
   - Color code as user types
   - Show suggestions inline

3. **Multi-line Input**
   - Support for long requests
   - Visual line continuation
   - Bracket matching

## ✅ Completion Checklist

## 📞 Support

### If backspace still doesn't work:

**Check 1: Readline available?**
```bash
docker exec -it qpcr-assistant python3 -c "import readline; print('OK')"
# Should print: OK
```

**Check 2: Terminal set correctly?**
```bash
docker exec -it qpcr-assistant bash -c "echo \$TERM"
# Should show: xterm-256color or similar
```

**Check 3: TTY allocated?**
```bash
docker exec -it qpcr-assistant tty
# Should show: /dev/pts/X (not "not a tty")
```

### If history doesn't work:

**Check history file:**
```bash
docker exec -it qpcr-assistant bash -c "ls -la ~/.qpcr_assistant_history"
# Should exist and have recent timestamp
```

## 🎉 Summary

### Problem (Three Stages)
1. **Stage 1:** Backspace showed `^H` instead of deleting text
2. **Stage 2:** After adding readline, backspace worked but still showed `^H` in some cases
3. **Stage 3:** Backspace deleted the prompt arrow `└─>` when pressed at beginning

### Root Causes
1. `docker attach` didn't provide proper TTY
2. Python's `input()` doesn't enable readline by default
3. **Color codes in prompts confused readline's cursor position calculation**

### Complete Solution
1. Switch to `docker exec -it` for proper TTY allocation
2. Import readline module
3. Configure readline with `setup_readline()`
4. **Create `colored_input()` helper with `\001`/`\002` escape sequences**
5. **Update all input prompts to use `colored_input()`**
6. Ensure proper terminal environment (`stty sane`, `TERM=xterm-256color`)

### Result
✅ **Full line editing capabilities**
✅ **Command history**
✅ **Professional terminal experience**
✅ **All editing shortcuts work**
✅ **Colored prompts work correctly** ← NEW!
✅ **Prompt protected from deletion** ← NEW!
✅ **Perfect cursor positioning** ← NEW!
